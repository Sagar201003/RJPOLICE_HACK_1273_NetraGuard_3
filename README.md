# RJPOLICE_HACK_1273_NetraGuard_3
Rajasthan Police Hackathon 
Solution:
1. Suspicious activity detection:
● It will detect anomalies like running, jumping, and crawling by analyzing the motion
patterns of tracked humans. We will keep a track of all the objects using Deep sort.

2. Multiple video panels:
● It can process multiple videos in real time.

3. Identify risky items:
● Will be able to detect weapons , and sharp objects like Knife , Sword , etc.

4. Fire and Smoke detection:
● Our model detects both fire and smoke, triggering an immediate alarm for rapid
response and enhanced safety measures.

5. Automatic number plate recognition system:
● We can add a number plate recognition system to our project , which may help
officials to keep a track on the vehicles of the criminals.
6. Anthropometry (body measurement detection):
●Measurement of the dimensions of the human body, primarily body size using
OpenPose and OpenCV.
7. Custom dataset:
● We can train our model on a custom dataset . given the dataset is relevant to the
topic . This makes our model flexible for users .

8. Interdisciplinary Approach:
● The development involves proper integration of software and hardware , making it
a challenging task suitable for an AI problem statement in a hackathon.

9. User Interface :
● Simple and User-friendly website . The dashboard will display the multiple real-time
input videos.
10. History of incidents:
● We will create a database that will have all the past incidents .This will help the
Police department to keep a track of all the incidents . It will include the date,time ,
place where the incident occurred.

11. Alert System:
● Our smart system quickly raises an alarm if it notices anything unusual or
suspicious. It also sends messages to officials about the activity .

12. Feedback :
● Proper feedback will be taken from the users, to make the system better.

Software and Technology:
1. Frontend:
● HTML, CSS, React.js
2. Backend:
● Django, Python
3. Database:
● PostgreSQL / Firebase
4. Model training:
